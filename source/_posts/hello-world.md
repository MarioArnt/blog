Hello World !

This is my first post on this *"micro-blog"*.

I made it using [hexo](https://hexo.io/), a dead-simple static website generator based on NodeJS.

I'll try to regularly post here articles related to web development in general.

Now (June 2019), I am mainly working on serverless architectures. Using typescript-written NodeJS lambda on back-end, and Vue or Angular in front-end.

So I guess my future articles will deal will these topics.

Stay tuned ;-)
